# Smart-Home-System-using-Bluetooth

This project is an Intelligent and Automated Smart Home System that allows users to control and monitor various home appliances through a mobile application via Bluetooth communication. Designed with convenience and energy efficiency in mind, this system provides a low-cost and user-friendly solution for home automation, enabling control over lights, fans, and other electrical devices without physical interaction. The system uses a microcontroller (such as Arduino or ESP32 with Bluetooth support) to interface with relays that control the appliances. A custom-built mobile app acts as the interface for the user, allowing them to send commands via Bluetooth, which are then interpreted by the microcontroller to switch the devices ON or OFF accordingly.

This smart home solution enhances both remote control and environment personalization by giving users the ability to manage their home settings based on their individual preferences. It is especially useful for elderly or physically challenged individuals who may have difficulty moving around to control home devices. Moreover, it contributes to energy saving by enabling users to turn off unused devices remotely. The system can be further expanded by incorporating features like voice control, scheduling, or sensors to automate responses based on environmental changes such as temperature or motion detection. This project provides a solid foundation for a cost-effective and scalable smart home solution, ideal for DIY enthusiasts and students exploring home automation.
